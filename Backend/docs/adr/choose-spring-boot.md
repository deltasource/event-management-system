# Architecture Decision Record (ADR) - Choice of Spring Boot as backend framework

## Status
- **Accepted**

## Context
The backend for the Event Management System project will be developed in Java. The chosen framework needs to provide:

An easy setup process,
Efficient integration with databases,
Robust security mechanisms,
Reliable testing frameworks.
## Decision
Spring Boot has been chosen as the backend framework for the application. It provides a set of production-ready features that enable rapid development with minimal configuration. Spring Boot is part of the broader Spring ecosystem, which includes a variety of tools and libraries, allowing for easy integration with other Spring modules such as Spring Security (for authentication and authorization) and Spring Data (for database access).

## Consequences
**Benefits**
- Faster development: It provides abstraction which allows us to focus more on building business logic rather than configuration and boilerplate code.
- Easier maintenance: With Spring Boot’s opinionated setup and strong conventions, we will have less configuration to manage, leading to cleaner and more maintainable code.
- Security: Spring Security, which integrates perfect with Spring Boot, provides strong security features such as authentication, authorization, and protection.

**Trade-offs**
- If you're building a lightweight application with minimal requirements, the full power of Spring Boot
may introduce unnecessary complexity and overhead.

While Spring Boot may introduce some complexity, particularly in a smaller or simpler application, the long-term benefits—such integrated security, easier maintenance, and enhanced productivity—outweigh the initial trade-offs.
The need for a secure, scalable, and easily maintainable backend for the Event Management System, which could evolve into a more complex system over time, makes Spring Boot an ideal choice.
